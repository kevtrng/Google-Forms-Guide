# Creating And Setting Up A Question

---

After creating a form, this section will teach you how to create and set up questions. It is important to set up your question properly so you can collect accurate information.

## Adding and Setting a Question

<br />

If you have just followed the steps to set up your Google form, there should be a question already created. You screen should look like this:

![Plus Button](https://github.com/kevtrng/Google-Forms-Guide/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/addingQuestions/1_addingAQuestion.png?raw=true)

Skip to step 2 if you see the question. If you do not see the question proceed to step 1.

**1. Click on the plus icon as shown in the image above.**

**2. Click on `Untitled Question` to enter your question.**

For example, "What is your favourite ice-cream flavour?"

![Question](https://github.com/kevtrng/Google-Forms-Guide/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/addingQuestions/2_Question.gif?raw=true)

**3. Click on `Multiple choice` to select a type of question.**

A menu with question types will appear.

**4. Click on the preferred question type.**

There are many different types of question that can be asked. For more information on question types, go to the [Type Of Questions](./typesOfQuestions.md) subsection.

**5. (Optional) Click on the toggle beside the `Required` on the bottom right of the question.**

The colour of the toggle should change from white to another colour. To change a question to optional, click on the toggle again. The colour should change back to white.

Questions can either be optional, or required. By default, the questions are set to be optional (the toggle is white).

## Setting Up the Options to Your Question

This section will go over how to add and remove an option to a multiple choice, checkbox, or dropdown question. For other question types, refer to the [Other Question Types](./typesOfQuestions.md) subsection.

There must be at least one option set.

**2. (Optional) Click on `Add option` to add another option to the question.**

A new option will appear.

Enter the option. Repeat until desired number of options are added.

![Add "Other"](https://github.com/kevtrng/Google-Forms-Guide/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/addingQuestions/3_addOther.png?raw=true)

This option is not available for dropdown.
