## Unable to Exit Form Preview

When previewing your form, the preview will open itself in a new tab. To exit out of the form preview, simply close the tab it is on by clicking on the `x` on the tab.

## Google Form Title Not Updating

When you rename your Google Form, the title on the top left corner and the title in the middle of the page should automatically change to match each other. If they do not match you must manually change the one the title that did not update

## Cannot Edit Google Form

If you cannot edit your form, you may not be logged in.

To log in, follow these steps:

**1. Refer to steps 1 and 2 from the [Setting Up a Google Form](./settingUpGoogleForm/settingUpGoogleForm.md) page.**

You should now see a list of recently accessed forms.

**2. Click on the form you want to edit.**

If you are logged in and cannot edit a form that you were previously able to, you may not be the owner for the form. Either contact the owner of the form to request for permissions to edit, or check if you are logged into the correct Google account.

## Accidental Deletion

Sometimes you may have delete something by accident. If that is the case hold down `cmd` button while pressing the `z` button on your keyboard. You may be able to undo the deletion.
